RULES
- Find as many words as possible in a jumbled grid of letters
- You are allowed to visit letters in any directions: left, right, up, dowm or diagonal
- Valid words must be 3 letters or longer





Our program creates a BoggleGrid containing a scrambled set of letters.



The human player will play first. The player will proceed to enter, one at a
time, each word they find on the grid. If a word meets the minimum length requirement (which is 4), has not been guessed before, and can be legally formed
given the arrangement of letters, it will be evaluated. This means it will be
checked against the list of legal words in the Dictionary. If the word exists, it
will be added to the player’s word list, and the player will be awarded points
according to the word’s length. If the word doesn’t appear in the Dictionary, the player won’t get any points.
The player indicates that they are through entering words by hitting return.
At this point, the computer will play. The computer will search through the
board looking for words the player didn’t find and award itself points for finding all those words. If the player wants to play again, the entire process will be
repeated.
